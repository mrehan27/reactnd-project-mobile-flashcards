# Mobile Flashcards

This is the final assessment project submitted for [Udacity's React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019). It contains codebase that can be used to run native apps on Android and iOS. Demo video similar to end results of this project can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_72MNWWaJuE). The goal of this project was to acheive these results:
* Match the criteria provided in the project specification of this course
* Using ESLint standard code styling
* Creating new JS files for each component and use import/require statements to include them where they are needed
* Commenting on code where required

Obviously, anyone can play around with this project but if trying to get React Nanodegree, please complete the project before looking into this code.

## Create React Native App
